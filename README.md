# Bookmarker website
This project is a simple "Bookmark Manager" web application built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It allows users to add, view, and delete their favorite website bookmarks.
# Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the web page and creating the form input fields.

CSS (Bootstrap): For styling and creating a responsive layout, using pre-built components like tables, buttons, and form controls.

JavaScript: For managing the logic, including adding bookmarks to the list, saving them in localStorage, and validating user inputs. The script ensures that URLs are properly formatted and capitalizes the first letter of the bookmark name.

Font Awesome: For adding icons to buttons (bookmark, link, and delete).
# Key Features:
Users can enter a website name and URL.

The app validates that the URL starts with http:// or https://, and automatically adds http:// if missing.

The website name is capitalized (first letter only) automatically before being displayed.

Bookmarks are stored in localStorage and persist even after the browser is closed.

Users can delete bookmarks from the list.

Bootstrap is used for responsive design, ensuring the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
